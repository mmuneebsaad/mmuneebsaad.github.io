I am Muhammad Muneeb Saad, currently a Lecturer (part-time) in the Department of Computer Science at Munster Technological University (MTU), Cork, Ireland, where I teach modules including Applied/Practical Machine Learning, Computer Architecture, Physical Computing, Linux Administration, and C Programming.  

Recently, I completed my PhD in Computing at MTU, specializing in **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Biomedical Image Analysis**. My doctoral thesis, *“Addressing Training Challenges of Generative Adversarial Networks for Biomedical Image Synthesis”*, explores innovative solutions to improve GAN training stability and enhance synthetic biomedical imagery. My PhD is supported by the prestigious **Risam Scholarship Award**, and I was honored with the **Lero Director’s Prize (2024)** for my contributions to GAN research in biomedical imaging.  

Before pursuing my doctorate, I earned an MSc in Electrical Engineering (Deep Learning and Time Series Analytics) from COMSATS University Islamabad, where my thesis focused on fraud detection using Recurrent Neural Networks. My academic journey began with a BSc in Electrical (Telecommunication) Engineering from Gomal University, Pakistan.  

Alongside my academic path, I have worked as a **Technical Content Writer** for international clients on Upwork.com, further strengthening my ability to communicate complex technical concepts clearly and effectively.  

My research interests include:  
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)  
- Biomedical Image Analysis  
- Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence  
- Large Language Models (LLMs)  
- Explainable AI  
- Data Science & Analytics  

I am passionate about **teaching, mentorship, and outreach**. I enjoy helping students explore computer science concepts and apply them in practical, real-world settings. I also regularly participate in international research communities through publications, conferences, and collaborations.
